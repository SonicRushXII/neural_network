To run the Neural Network run "App.java"
Then after that to test it out go and execute "ImageWriter.java"

App.java will generate a neural network or pick the current one.
And then ImageWriter.java will then perform forward passes using the MNIST dataset and evaluate the efficiency of the Neural Network
